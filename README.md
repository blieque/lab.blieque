# [lab.blieque](https://blieque.github.io)

Being one who is learning a lot in the field of web design and development, I often feel the desire to test and experiment. Creating a platform for me to do such is the purpose of the lab.

Each of the experiments in the lab is typically a small web-app I've built for a particular purpose. Many are are unfinished, but intend to change this before skipping away over the hills to start more. 

## Licence

It's frequent that I head to StackOverflow, the MDN or CSS-Tricks to figure something out, and I appreciate these resources greatly. The lab is licenced under GPL v2, unless otherwise stated.
